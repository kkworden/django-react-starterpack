* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

Clone the repository and `cd` into the directory.

Open a shell and run `pipenv install` to install the necessary Python dependencies.

Next, run `pipenv shell` to activate the virtual environment.

In a separate shell, run `npm i` to install the necessary NPM dependencies and `npm run webpack` to start Webpack bundling.
